## 14. try to eliminate the delay between pressing "Lookup" and showing the progress
       dialog on sm
## 19. bug: hide sip on main page, go to register, hide sip, "later" to go back
       to main page. Main page doesn't refresh i.e. sip is hidden but the window
       is not sized correctly. Fix: remember and restore state of sip before
       bringing the dialog? Or maybe force WM_SIZE?
## 20. Ctrl-Q to quit on PPC

    * POSSIBLY AFTER V1 *
## 1. ability to change font size (like in iNoah/sm)

      without re-downloading the article
## 5. display russian tekst (see e.g. "nabokov")
## 6. speedup formatting

"Cancel" button and progress report.
## 9. ability to select a font on PPC
## 10. ability to change background color/text color

## 12. a better way to select bookmarks. requires changes to rendering engine

## 18. small fixes to scrollbar position on sm (move it up by 2px) (2004-08-20)

## 17. make a separate pocket pc 2003 build (2004-08-18)

## 9. improve (de-couple) LastResults.cpp dialog (2004-08-18)

## 9. sm, in "Extended search result", don't select any string in a list if we're 
in the text field. (2004-08-18)

## 18. figure out the "Data call. invalid skin" problem. (2004-08-18 - using
HWND_BROADCAST in SendEvent() was the problem).

## 3. fix the icon (2004-08-16)

## 6. use StringListDialog common with iNoah for showing 'list hyperlinks'
(2004-08-15)

## 4. registration bug
Repro:
* enter registration screen
* while reg field is empty, press "Register" button
Observed: nothing happens, menus are disabled - we can scroll and enter a word
but not launch query

Problem was: if a reg code field was empty, we wouldn't send 
Verify-Registration-Code field in a query, so the server would just echo 
Transaction-ID back and we didn't handle that in any way.
(2004-08-15)

## 5. common enter reg code dialog with iNoah (2004-08-12)

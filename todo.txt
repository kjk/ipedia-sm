## 1. shorter connection timeout so that when the server is down, doesn't wait so long?
## 2. ability to cancel request e.g. during transfer we change to a form with only
"Cancel" button and progress report.
## 3. fix the icon
## 7. improve (de-couple) LastResults.cpp dialog
## 8. rendering bug, see "The Doors (album)" at the end list of Personnel

        *  DONE   *

## 6. use StringListDialog common with iNoah for showing 'list hyperlinks'

## 4. registration bug
Repro:
* enter registration screen
* while reg field is empty, press "Register" button
Observed: nothing happens, menus are disabled - we can scroll and enter a word
but not launch query

Problem was: if a reg code field was empty, we wouldn't send 
Verify-Registration-Code field in a query, so the server would just echo 
Transaction-ID back and we didn't handle that in any way.

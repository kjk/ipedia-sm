1. shorter connection timeout so that when the server is down, doesn't wait so long?
2. ability to cancel request e.g. during transfer we change to a form with only
"Cancel" button and progress report.
3. fix the icon
4. registration bug
Repro:
* enter registration screen
* while reg field is empty, press "Register" button
Observed: nothing happens, menus are disabled - we can scroll and enter a word
but not launch query

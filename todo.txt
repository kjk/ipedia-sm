## 1. shorter connection timeout so that when the server is down, doesn't wait so long?
## 2. ability to cancel request e.g. during transfer we change to a form with only
"Cancel" button and progress report.
## 7. improve (de-couple) LastResults.cpp dialog
## 9. sm, in "Extended search result", don't select any string in a list if we're 
in the text field.
## 10. fix "hyperlinks" list in PPC build
## 13. in PPC, when SIP state is changed in enter reg code dialog and we get back
       to main screen, SIP changes are not reflected.
## 14. try to eliminate the delay between pressing "Lookup" and showing the progress
       dialog on sm

        *  DONE   *

## 11. fix "enter reg code" dialog in PPC build (2004-08-16)

## 8. rendering bug, see "The Doors (album)" at the end list of Personnel
The problem: \t (tab) is mis-rendered (2004-08-16)

## 12. in PPC (and smartphone too?) version, "re-enter reg code" doesn't show 
       previous reg code. (2004-08-16)

## 3. fix the icon (2004-08-16)

## 6. use StringListDialog common with iNoah for showing 'list hyperlinks'
(2004-08-15)

## 4. registration bug
Repro:
* enter registration screen
* while reg field is empty, press "Register" button
Observed: nothing happens, menus are disabled - we can scroll and enter a word
but not launch query

Problem was: if a reg code field was empty, we wouldn't send 
Verify-Registration-Code field in a query, so the server would just echo 
Transaction-ID back and we didn't handle that in any way.

## 5. common enter reg code dialog with iNoah (2004-08-12)
